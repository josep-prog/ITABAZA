#### Room Assignment Function
```javascript
function assignRoom(appointmentId) {
  const HOSPITAL_ROOMS = {
    total: 20,
    rooms: Array.from({length: 20}, (_, i) => `Room-${String(i + 1).padStart(2, '0')}`)
  };
  
  const hash = appointmentId.split('').reduce((a, b) => {
    a = ((a << 5) - a) + b.charCodeAt(0);
    return a & a;
  }, 0);
  const roomIndex = Math.abs(hash) % HOSPITAL_ROOMS.total;
  return HOSPITAL_ROOMS.rooms[roomIndex];
}
```

#### Venue Information Generation
```javascript
const venueInfo = appointmentType === 'video-call' 
  ? {
      type: 'Video Call',
      url: 'https://itabaza-videocall.onrender.com/',
      location: 'Online Meeting'
    }
  : {
      type: 'In-Person Visit',
      url: 'https://itabaza-videocall.onrender.com/',

This implementation ensures that the appointment confirmation system is robust, scalable, and provides an excellent user experience while maintaining the professional standards expected in healthcare communications.
