# üìû Video Call Feature Implementation Guide

## üéØ Overview
This implementation adds comprehensive video call functionality to your ITABAZA appointment system, including:
- **23 video call rooms** with automatic assignment
- **Room conflict prevention**
- **Payment-based access control**
- **Enhanced patient and doctor dashboards**
- **Video call URL generation**

## üöÄ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Database Changes
- ‚úÖ Added video call fields to appointments table:
  - `video_call_url` - URL for the video call session
  - `video_call_room_id` - Room ID (1-23)
  - `video_call_room_name` - Human-readable room name
- ‚úÖ Created database functions for room management
- ‚úÖ Added triggers for automatic room assignment

### 2. Backend Updates
- ‚úÖ Enhanced appointment model with video call methods
- ‚úÖ Updated appointment router to handle video calls
- ‚úÖ Created enhanced dashboard router for both patients and doctors
- ‚úÖ Added API endpoints for video call management

### 3. Frontend Updates
- ‚úÖ Enhanced patient dashboard with video call links
- ‚úÖ Created doctor dashboard with video call functionality
- ‚úÖ Added room information display
- ‚úÖ Payment-based access control for video links

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### Database Files
- `add-video-call-features.sql` - Database migration script
- `apply-video-call-migration.js` - Migration application script

### Backend Files
- `models/appointment.model.js` - Enhanced with video call methods
- `routers/appointment.router.js` - Updated for video call support
- `routers/enhanced-dashboard.router.js` - New dashboard API
- `index.js` - Updated to include new routes

### Frontend Files
- `doctor-dashboard-enhanced.html` - New enhanced doctor dashboard
- `Scripts/doctor-dashboard-enhanced.js` - Doctor dashboard JavaScript
- `Scripts/patient-dashboard-new.js` - Enhanced patient dashboard
- Patient dashboard HTML already existed and works with enhanced JS

### Test Files
- `test-video-call-functionality.js` - Comprehensive test suite

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)
You've already applied the database migration. The schema includes:
```sql
-- Video call fields added to appointments table
video_call_url VARCHAR(500)
video_call_room_id INTEGER
video_call_room_name VARCHAR(100)
```

### 2. Server Configuration
Your server is already configured with the enhanced routes. The following endpoints are available:

#### Patient APIs
- `GET /api/dashboard/patient/:patientId/dashboard` - Dashboard stats
- `GET /api/dashboard/patient/:patientId/appointments` - Patient appointments
- `GET /api/dashboard/patient/:patientId/appointments/:appointmentId` - Appointment details

#### Doctor APIs
- `GET /api/dashboard/doctor/:doctorId/dashboard` - Doctor dashboard stats
- `GET /api/dashboard/doctor/:doctorId/patients` - Doctor's patients
- `GET /api/appointments/doctor/:doctorId` - Doctor appointments

#### Video Call APIs
- `GET /api/dashboard/video-appointments` - Video call appointments
- `GET /api/dashboard/video-rooms/available` - Available rooms

### 3. Frontend Usage

#### For Patients (Enhanced Dashboard)
```javascript
// Patient dashboard automatically shows:
// - Video call appointments with room info
// - "Join Video Call" button for paid appointments
// - Room name (e.g., "ITABAZA-Room-01")
// - Payment status-based access control
```

#### For Doctors (New Enhanced Dashboard)
```javascript
// Doctor dashboard includes:
// - Separate "Video Calls" section
// - Room information for each appointment
// - "Join Video Call" links
// - Patient management features
```

## üéÆ How It Works

### Video Call Flow
1. **Booking**: Patient books appointment with `consultation_type: 'video-call'`
2. **Room Assignment**: System automatically assigns available room (1-23)
3. **Payment**: After payment confirmation, `payment_status` becomes `true`
4. **Access**: Video call URL becomes available to both patient and doctor
5. **Join**: Both parties can join via `https://itabaza-videocall.onrender.com/room/{roomId}`

### Room Management
- **23 rooms available**: ITABAZA-Room-01 through ITABAZA-Room-23
- **Conflict prevention**: Same room can't be booked for same date/time
- **Automatic assignment**: Finds first available room for the time slot
- **Clean URLs**: Each room has a unique, professional URL

### Access Control
- **Payment-based**: Video links only visible after payment confirmation
- **Role-based**: Both patients and doctors see appropriate information
- **Status-based**: Different UI states for pending/paid/completed appointments

## üé® UI Features

### Patient View
- ‚úÖ Video call appointments clearly marked with video icon
- ‚úÖ Room name displayed (e.g., "Room: ITABAZA-Room-05")
- ‚úÖ "Join Video Call" button for paid appointments
- ‚úÖ Payment pending message for unpaid appointments
- ‚úÖ Enhanced appointment details modal with video info

### Doctor View
- ‚úÖ Dedicated "Video Calls" section in sidebar
- ‚úÖ Video call appointments with room information
- ‚úÖ Patient management with appointment history
- ‚úÖ Room-specific join links
- ‚úÖ Payment status indicators

## üîç Testing

Run the test suite to verify functionality:
```bash
cd /home/joe/SUBMISSION/ITABAZA/Backend
node test-video-call-functionality.js
```

The test verifies:
- ‚úÖ Database schema updates
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Room assignment functions (minor SQL compatibility issues)
- ‚úÖ Appointment creation with video calls
- ‚úÖ API endpoint availability

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples

### Creating a Video Call Appointment
```javascript
const appointmentData = {
  consultation_type: 'video-call',
  // ... other appointment fields
  payment_status: true // Required for video link access
};
```

### Accessing Video Call Information
```javascript
// Patient dashboard automatically shows:
if (appointment.consultation_type === 'video-call' && appointment.payment_status) {
  // Show: Join Video Call button
  // Display: Room name and URL
}
```

## üéØ Next Steps for You

### 1. Test the Implementation
1. Open your patient dashboard: `patient-dashboard-new.html`
2. Open your doctor dashboard: `doctor-dashboard-enhanced.html`
3. Book a video call appointment through your booking system
4. Verify room assignment and URL generation

### 2. Customize as Needed
- **Branding**: Update video call URLs if you want different branding
- **Room Count**: Modify the 23-room limit if needed
- **UI Styling**: Customize colors/styling to match your brand

### 3. Production Deployment
- Your backend is already configured
- Frontend files are ready to use
- Database migration is complete

## üîó Key URLs and Features

### Video Call System
- **Base URL**: `https://itabaza-videocall.onrender.com/`
- **Room URLs**: `https://itabaza-videocall.onrender.com/room/{1-23}`
- **Room Names**: `ITABAZA-Room-01`, `ITABAZA-Room-02`, etc.

### Dashboard Access
- **Patient Dashboard**: Use existing `patient-dashboard-new.html`
- **Doctor Dashboard**: Use new `doctor-dashboard-enhanced.html`
- **Admin Dashboard**: Existing admin features preserved
